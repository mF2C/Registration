		<h3>Consent for using mF2C</h3>
		<p>
			<b>mF2C (Towards an Open, Secure, Decentralized and Coordinated Fog-to-Cloud Management Ecosystem)</b> is EU's Horizon 2020 collaborative research project (grant agreement number 730929). It focuses on the design and development of an open, secure, privacy-friendly, decentralized, and multi-stakeholder management framework for novel fog-to-cloud system architectures. The use of mF2C requires user’s registration and connection of his/her devices. These devices then continuously collect sensor  device data and share it with mF2C to benefit from its ability to manage the devices and optimize the use of their resources. The types of data collected and processed during by mF2C are presented in the table below. Note that the data are only processed by mF2C and not shared by mF2C with anyone outside of the system. The user can, at any time, access and manage the collected data in the mF2C management dashboard. If/when the user requests the deletion of the data or the account, the data are immediately deleted or made anonymous.
